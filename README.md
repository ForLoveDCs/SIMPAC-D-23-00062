Abstract: Detection of an earthâ€™s subsurface velocity profile is very essential for geotechnical site investigation. Basically, multimode Love wave dispersion curves (DCs) can be used for detecting the subsurface velocity structure. Here, the ForLoveDCs is introduced as a set function of MATLAB that may be used to perform the calculation of forward modeling multimode Love wave dispersion curves. In general, ForLoveDCs has running well and successfully computing the multimode Love Wave DCs. The computation procedure tested on the synthetic model representing the regularly and irregularly velocity structure profiles. Manifestly, all computation results show the reasonable and reliability DCs.
